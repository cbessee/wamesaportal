== Changelog ==

= 1.5.4 =
* Fixed up initialisation over FTP/SSH

= 1.5.3 =
* Fixed up PHP notices when form fields are empty in PDF

= 1.5.2 =
* Fix up javascript error on initialisation page

= 1.5.1 =
* Included fallback for PHP5.3+ function array_replace_recursive()
* Fix up initialisation which wasn't running correctly for some users

= 1.5.0 =
* $form_data array had a new 'options' key added to radio, select and checkboxes which includes ALL avaliable options in the form. 
* Most fields had a new 'type' key added, which allows you to easily determine what field type it is. 
* Fixed bug where Formidable Plus key was still using the old field ID access key instead of new field key access key.

= 1.4.0 =
* Update mPDF package to latest version. Based on testing, it shouldn't have any major effect on custom templates but does correct padding/margin bugs (which could throw off some heavily-customised templates). 
* Added a 'return' type when calling FPPDF_Entry::show_entry() which allowed for greater manipulation of the output
* Added 'section headings' to the default template (previously ignored). These will be added with <h2> tags. 
* Added ability to exclude fields from the default template by using the 'exclude' class on a form field. 

= 1.3.0 =
* Changed $form_data array keys to use the unique field key instead of the field ID. This means if you are importing and exporting forms across multiple website your PDF template will function without any additional changes. 

Note: This release isn't backwards compatible with custom PDF templates.
